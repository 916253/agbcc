/* Jim Meyering writes:

   "... Some ctype macros are valid only for character codes that
   isascii says are ASCII (SGI's IRIX-4.0.5 is one such system --when
   using /bin/cc or gcc but without giving an ansi option).  So, all
   ctype uses should be through macros like ISPRINT...  If
   STDC_HEADERS is defined, then autoconf has verified that the ctype
   macros don't need to be guarded with references to isascii. ...
   Defining isascii to 1 should let any compiler worth its salt
   eliminate the && through constant folding."

   Bruno Haible adds:

   "... Furthermore, isupper(c) etc. have an undefined result if c is
   outside the range -1 <= c <= 255. One is tempted to write isupper(c)
   with c being of type `char', but this is wrong if c is an 8-bit
   character >= 128 which gets sign-extended to a negative value.
   The macro ISUPPER protects against this as well."  */
